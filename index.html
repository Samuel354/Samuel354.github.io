            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>In terms of my future career, my biggest hope is that it’s a career that I’m content with 
pursuing, and preferably one that I find enjoyable or fun. A career related to 
programming is what I’m aiming for, and one I’m currently pursuing with a major in 
computer science. I believe that there’s a lot of enjoyment I could potentially have 
with programming, especially with paths such as game development, where I get to 
create something that I’m passionate about.</p>
